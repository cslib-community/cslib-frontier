# The polynomial `k`-wise independent hash family

For a finite field `F`, the polynomials of degree less than `k`, evaluated as maps `F → F` and
indexed by their coefficient vectors `c : Fin k → F`, form a `k`-wise independent hash family
(`Cslib.Probability.isKWiseIndependentHash_polynomialHash`) [Vadhan, Section 3.5.5][Vadhan2012].
The shared ascending-coefficient evaluator `Cslib.Probability.polynomialHash` is defined in
`CslibFrontier.Probability.HashFamily.Polynomial`. By Lagrange interpolation, every
assignment of values to at most `k` points is attained by a polynomial of degree less than `k`,
and evaluation depends additively on the coefficients, so the surjectivity criterion
`Cslib.Probability.isKWiseIndependentHash_of_surjective` applies. The seed consists of `k` field
elements. For `k = 2` these are the affine maps `x ↦ c₀ + c₁ x` of
`Cslib.Probability.isPairwiseIndependentHash_affineHash` in dimension one.

## Main definitions

* `Cslib.Probability.polynomialHash`: shared evaluation of the polynomial with coefficients `c`.

## Main results

* `Cslib.Probability.isKWiseIndependentHash_polynomialHash`: the polynomials of degree less than
  `k` form a `k`-wise independent hash family.
