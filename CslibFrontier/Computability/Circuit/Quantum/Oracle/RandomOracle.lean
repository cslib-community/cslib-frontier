# Finite random oracles for native quantum executions

`Quantum.RandomOracle.sample` draws one complete finite Boolean table outside an experiment.
`Quantum.RandomOracle.runWith` specializes this operation to an existing native quantum
controller: the coherent device handler and the classical service factory receive the same table
for the complete adaptive run.

The coherent operation is the existing XOR oracle unitary
`|x, y⟩ ↦ |x, y + H(x)⟩`. These definitions only package finite eager-table semantics around that
operation. Drawing the table is not asserted to be efficient and is not charged to the native
controller. The controller's elementary-gate, coherent-query, measurement and classical-service
costs remain the separate existing resources.

This module does not establish a lazy/coherent equivalence, an unbounded or variable-length
random oracle, reprogramming, extraction, one-way-to-hiding, query depth, gate approximation,
equivalence with arbitrary QPPT adversaries or a protocol security theorem.

## Main definitions

* `Cslib.Quantum.RandomOracle.sample`: sample one table outside a finite experiment.
* `Cslib.Quantum.RandomOracle.runWith`: run one native controller with shared coherent and
  classical access to the sampled table.

## Main results

* `Cslib.Quantum.RandomOracle.sample_const`: an experiment that does not inspect the table is
  unchanged.
* `Cslib.Quantum.RandomOracle.runWith_eq`: the controller wrapper is exactly one outer table draw
  followed by the existing fixed-table execution.
