# Componentwise resources for concrete security

Concrete reductions need to retain static descriptions and charge online execution without
identifying unrelated units. An explicit `InstalledArtifact` list records each stored occurrence.
Per-kind description sizes are sums over that inventory, so distinct stored copies contribute
separately, while components inlined into a final artifact are not charged again. Adversaries,
reducers and generic or main programs have independent coordinates; separately installed handlers
and static tables or advice use their own occurrences too. `AttackResources` adds the common
execution coordinates; `Fits` and `IsPolynomial` keep every comparison and asymptotic bound
componentwise.

Offline generation is not online time unless the attack executes it. A generated artifact is still
an installed occurrence, whether its compiler ran online or offline. A canonical phase ledger
records input reading, compilation and its output copy, marshalling, tags, dispatch, request/reply
handling, handler/interpreter/controller work, and final-output production and copying. Its time sum
and peak workspace are certified against the aggregate online coordinates. Compiler and final-
output accounting refer to ledger phases rather than adding duplicate time or workspace fields.

This module sums only the times of the named online phases and takes their workspace maximum. It
supplies no scalar total across unrelated units; any further aggregation must state its units and
be proved separately. It also supplies no program, circuit or controller: callers provide exact
retained artifacts and prove that their executions fit the declared budget.

## Main definitions

* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.InstalledArtifactKind`: roles for independently retained static artifacts.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.InstalledArtifact`: one occurrence in the installed static inventory.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.OnlinePhaseLedger`: named online phases with exact aggregate operations.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.ExecutedCompilerResources`: executed compiler input and output lengths.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackExecutionResources`: online, compiler, oracle and communication costs.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources`: installed inventory plus execution resources.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.CompilerInstallation`: separate or inlined representation of compiler logic.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources.Fits`: componentwise finite-budget comparison.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources.AccountsForExecutedCompiler`: an online compiler and its
  emitted installed program are certified and charged without duplicating inlined code.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources.AccountsForOnlinePhases`: a model certificate connects the
  ledger to execution and its exact time/workspace aggregates.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources.AccountsForOutput`: initial input, emitted output and copying
  are connected to a model-specific execution certificate.
* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.AttackResources.IsPolynomial`: componentwise polynomial resource families.

## Main results

* `Cslib.Crypto.Game.IndistinguishableWithin.indistinguishable_attackResources`: specialize the
  existing finite-to-asymptotic bridge to componentwise attack resources.
