# SNOVA's bounded signing-attempt schedule

SNOVA derives fresh vinegar variables for a signing attempt from a one-byte counter `numsig`.
Algorithm 17 of [SNOVA2026] increments this counter before an attempt and returns failure when the
incremented counter is `255`, before deriving those variables. Algorithm 14 uses the surviving
counter value as part of the SHAKE256 input. Thus a signing invocation tries exactly the increasing
bytes `1, ..., 254`; neither `0` nor the failure sentinel `255` is tried.

This module records only that source-level schedule. It makes no claim about the distribution or
independence of the resulting linear systems, their solvability, or SNOVA's signing-failure
probability. In particular, a loop with 254 attempted counters does not by itself justify the
reference implementation's informal probability estimate.

## Main definitions

* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.signingAttemptCounters`: the exact attempted counter bytes.

## Main results

* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.length_signingAttemptCounters`: exactly 254 attempts are scheduled.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.getElem_signingAttemptCounters`: attempt index `i` uses byte `i + 1`.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.mem_signingAttemptCounters_iff`: exactly bytes 1 through 254 occur.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.pairwise_lt_signingAttemptCounters`: the schedule is strictly increasing.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.nodup_signingAttemptCounters`: no counter byte is attempted twice.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.first_signingAttemptCounter`: the first attempted counter is 1.
* `Cslib.Crypto.SNOVA.last_signingAttemptCounter`: the last attempted counter is 254.
