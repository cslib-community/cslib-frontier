# Assumptions inventory

A security theorem may assume named hardness assumptions: Prop-valued definitions documented as assumptions, such as `F.DDH setup`, `DecisionLWE …` or `OneWay f`, including a security notion of a component that the caller supplies ([AGENTS.md, Security theorems](../../AGENTS.md#security-theorems)). This page lists every such assumption that a theorem in `Cslib.Crypto` takes, and the hardness assumptions the library defines. For each it says where the definition comes from:

- **standard**: the docstring cites the source definition. The row gives the bibliography key of [references.bib](../../references.bib) and the locator, and says "locator not verified" until someone has checked the locator at the source. *Deviations or relation* names every material difference from the source, such as an arbitrary setup law where the source has an efficient parameter generator.
- **novel**: no cited source states the assumption. Its docstring says that it is novel to this library, and *Deviations or relation* says how it relates to standard assumptions (it follows from one, implies one, or neither) and why it is plausible. A novel assumption may support a result presented as original. A theorem that rests on it names it, and is never presented as a cited result: that would be a stand-in under [Faithful headlines](../../AGENTS.md#faithful-headlines) rule 2.
- **vocabulary**: a generic notion that becomes an assumption only through the instance a theorem supplies, such as concrete security against a caller's adversary class.

*Nonvacuity* links a test that shows the assumption fails for an insecure instance (for example a fixed group, a zero noise law or a constant function), where the library has one.

[check_hardness_assumptions.py](../../scripts/check_hardness_assumptions.py) reads the built library after `lake build CslibFrontier`. It finds every premise of a public Crypto theorem headed by a Prop-valued declaration whose definition mentions negligibility, an advantage or indistinguishability, and checks it against this page. An unregistered assumption fails. So does a standard assumption whose docstring cites none of its row's keys, a novel assumption whose docstring does not say "novel to this library", a "locator not verified", and a theorem resting on a novel assumption that does not name it, or that cites a source without saying that it is a step. The existing gaps are recorded, each with a justification, in [hardness_assumptions_baseline.json](../../scripts/hardness_assumptions_baseline.json), which may only shrink. `python3 scripts/check_hardness_assumptions.py --list` prints the theorems that rest on each assumption. The audit behind this page is [#5578](https://github.com/cslib-community/cslib-frontier/issues/5578).

The check does not judge whether a definition matches its source, whether a locator is right, or whether a theorem that claims a cited result rests on the assumption that the source uses. Review does ([Review cycle](../../AGENTS.md#review-cycle)).

Names are relative to `Cslib.Crypto`.
